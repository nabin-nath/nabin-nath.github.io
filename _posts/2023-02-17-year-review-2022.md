> Itâ€™s been a while since I wrote my last blog post, more than a year now. This post is basically a summary of what I have been upto personally and professionally in the last one year.

## Professional Life

### Aktech Labs

I joined Aktech Labs in 2021 around July, this year around Feb I left Aktech Labs. I mainly wanted to work on myself and as the placement season was approaching I wanted to put some time on myself. Overall working here was wonderful, I worked as a Software Developer Intern for about 6 months and it was full of challenges. Amit(CEO) was so humble and helped me a lot while I was working here.

### Weekday

I joined [Weekday](https://www.linkedin.com/company/weekdayworks/mycompany/) as a Software Engineering Intern in the starting week of May, I was working on a product named [Referral Tool](https://dream.weekday.works/), and we were a five-member Team, [Amit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitsy/), [Anubhav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/am37/), [Pranshu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pd2610/), [Vyshnavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vyshnavi-vanamala-8b737b121/), and me. At first, it was a bit scary, the code base was too big, and also I had never worked on chrome extensions before. The first month passed somehow, btw I was working part-time for the first month, as I had my end semester exams. It was a remote opportunity but as I had my summer vacation I asked Anubhav(CTO) to allow me to come to Bangalore and work from the office. He agreed, and I went to Bangalore and worked from the office for the next two months.

The learning curve while working from the office was huge. It was here at Weekday that I came to know about scrum, product lifecycle, how to take ownership of your code, and mostly code reviews. My PRâ€™s used to have too many comments, but as time passed they became fewer.

To be honest many things went wrong this year, but It was the Weekday that brought back my confidence, and I met many wonderful people here ðŸš€.

### Wells Fargo

I got a full-time offer from Wells Fargo, It was an on-campus opportunity ðŸ˜Œ. They conducted 3 rounds, first an online coding round, then 2 technical interviews. The difficulty level was between easy and medium, my interview was mainly around DBMS, OOPS, Projects, Intern experiences, and One Coding question.

## Personal Life

### Bangalore diaries

I stayed in Bangalore for two months, June and July with my friend [Kanishk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanishk12/). We were staying in Zolo PG at Koramangala. My office was in Indiranagar. I used to take a bus from Ejipura signal or book Rapido to go to the office.

I use to work on weekdays and was only free for two days on the weekends, so I used them to the fullest, things I did there were:

- Went to a Standup comedy show
- Went to Lalbagh Botanical Garden
- Went to Tirupati Balaji Temple
- Went on a team lunch with my colleagues
- Went to watch Thor love and thunder, it was waste of time :)

There are many things that I liked about Bangalore, and out of those I would like to mention a few, one is Dunzo, Blinkit, and Zepto. They have made life so easy in Bangalore. You can get anything delivered to your doorstep in 10 mins. The first day when we were in our PG, around 2 in the night we saw cockroaches in our room, we asked the caretaker to get rid of them, and he said he will do it in the morning, as he doesn't have Hit, so we ordered a Hit on Dunzo, they came in 5 mins and gave us our order. Dunzo was active at 2 in the night, this thing amazed me.

The second that I liked here was the weather, Bangalore has very pleasant weather, it was not too hot and not too cold. I used to go for walk with Kanishk in the evening, and it was so nice, but also Bangalore has unexpected rains, it rains for 10 mins and then stops, it was so weird. Overall it was a wonderful experience.
