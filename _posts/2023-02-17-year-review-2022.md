> Itâ€™s been a while since I wrote my last blog post, more than a year now. This post is basically a summary of what I have been upto personally and professionally in the last one year.

## Professional Life

### Aktech Labs

I joined Aktech Labs in 2021 around July, this year around Feb I left Aktech Labs. I mainly wanted to work on myself and as the placement season was approaching I wanted to put some time on myself. Overall working here was wonderful, I worked as a Software Developer Intern for about 6 months and it was full of challenges. Amit was so humble and helped me a lot while I was working here.

### Weekday

I joined Weekday as a Software Engineering Intern in the starting week of may, I was working on a product named Referral Tool, we were a five member Team, Pranshu, Vyshnavi, Amit, Anubhav and me. At first it was a bit scary, the code base was too big, and also I had never worked on chrome extensions before. The first month passed somehow, btw I was working part-time for the first month, as I had my end sems. It was a remote opportunity but as I had my summer vacations I asked Anubhav(CTO) to allow me to come to Bangalore and work from the office. He agreed, and I went to Bangalore and worked from the office for the next two months.

The learning curve while working from the office was huge. It was here at Weekday that I came to know about scrum, product lifecycle, how to take ownership of your code and mostly code reviews. My PRâ€™s used to have too many comments, but as time passed it became less.

To be honest many things went wrong this year, but It was the Weekday that brought back my confidence, and I met many wonderful people here ðŸš€.

### Wells Fargo

I got a full time offer from Wells Fargo, It was an on campus opportunity ðŸ˜Œ. They conducted 3 rounds, first an online coding round, then 2 technical interviews. The difficulty level was between easy and medium, my interview was mainly around DBMS, OOPS, Projects, Intern experiences and One Coding question.

## Personal Life

### Bangalore diaries

I stayed in Bangalore for two months, June and July with my friend Kanishk. We were staying in Zolo PG at Koramangala. My office was in Indiranagar. I used to take a bus from Ejipura signal or book Rapido to go to the office.

I use to work on weekdays and was only free for two days in the weekends, so I used them at the fullest, things I did at there were:

- Went to a Standup comedy show
- Went to Lalbagh Botanical Garden
- Went to Tirupati Balaji Temple
- Went on a team lunch with my colleagues
- Went to watch Thor love and thunder, it was waste of time :)

There are many things that I liked about Bangalore, out of those I would like to mention a few, one is Dunzo, Blinkit, Zepto. They have made life so easy in Bangalore. You can get anything delivered to your doorstep in 10 mins. The first day when we were in our PG, around 2 in the night we saw cockroaches in our room, we asked the caretaker to get rid of them, he said he will do it in the morning, as he doesn't has Hit, so we ordered a Hit on Dunzo, they came in 5 mins and gave us our order. Dunzo was active at 2 in the night, this thing amazed me.
