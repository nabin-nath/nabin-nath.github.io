## Professional Life

### Weekday

I was working with Weekday as a Software Engineering Intern, and it had been around a year now, around march I left Weekday and started to focus on open-source contributions as this was the domain I never explored before. I learned a lot here and met many wonderful people who helped me grow as a Software Engineer.

### Wells Fargo

Wells Fargo is a US Bank. I got an offer to join Wells last year through campus placements, this year around July I joined Wells as an FTE, and I am working in the supply chain management area. Working in wells is going smoothly till now and I am still learning how such big organizations work.

## Personal Life

2023 was the most happening year for me to date, didnâ€™t have any plans or goals at the start of the year and was just going with the flow, but now when I look back I can see that there were many things that I did this year that I am proud of. I tried being regular in the gym over the start of the year but towards the end got a bit lazy, I went on a lot of trips with my friends this year(I went on to explore new places every month till June ðŸ«£)

Around July joined Wells Fargo and shifted to Bangalore, talking about Bangalore the weather is nice here but traffic is terrible, I live 7km far from my office but If I take an office cab to come back from the office it takes me 1hr to reach my apartment. The weekdays are busy, Wells has a 3 days work from office policy so 2 days I work from home. The weekends are okay, many weekends we went to movies and bowling, explored Bangalore, ate new foods, and played table tennis/basketball.

This year I started watching Anime for the first time and now I understand why people are such crazy fans of anime. I have finished Naruto and plan to start Jujutsu Kaisen soon, apart from these, other things that I did this year were

- Graduated from college
- Traveled a lot
  - Dalhousie - Jan
  - Tirthan Valley, Shoja, Jalori Pass - Feb
  - Bike trip to Prashar(Mandi), Manali, Sissu - March
  - Churdhar Trek, Shimla, my School in Solan - April
  - Dharamshala, watched IPL in the most beautiful Stadium in India - May
  - Vaishno Devi, Katra - May
  - Kedarnath, Devprayag - May
  - Shirdi, Thryambakeshwara(Nasik) - Dec
- Tried being consistent in gym(able to squat 1.5times my body weight)
- Played a lot of table tennis

In 2024 I will try to focus more on the gym, learning video editing, starting to invest in the stock market, and if possible reading books ðŸ«£, I also tried last year and started with Atomic Habits, but lost interest midway through reading it.
